## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I'm still want to improve my logic and also learn to write clean code, this project still can pass through changes and refactoring while I get more knowledges.

### Useful resources

But the technique that I used was diferent but you can also use this one.
